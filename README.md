# Cream

## About
Cream is a 3D game engine written in C++ using modern OpenGL.

## Status
Definitely a work in progress and not currently in a usable state. No plans to add sound.

## Requirements
- A C++17 compiler
- GLFW
- CMake

## Build instructions
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kz04px/cream
mkdir cream/build
cd cream/build
cmake ..
make
```

## Examples
- Basic - Not particularly functional, just some simplistic feature usage.
